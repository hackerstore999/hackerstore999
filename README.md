## 💫 About Me
I’m a disciplined and driven **Electronics & Communication Engineering** student passionate about solving problems through **data science**, **machine learning**, and **human-centered design**. With hands-on experience from **three+ internships** across UI/UX design, electronics testing, and data-driven projects, I bring a rare ability to bridge hardware and software solutions.

I’ve led and contributed to academic and real-world projects using **Python, SQL, Pandas, TensorFlow, and Figma**, delivering prototypes and solutions that improved user experience, enhanced system performance, and met tight deadlines.

My goal is to contribute to **innovative, high-impact projects** in data science, machine learning, or product design, while continuously expanding my skills in **predictive analytics, data visualization, and emerging AI tools**.
